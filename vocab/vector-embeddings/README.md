# Vector Embeddings Project

## Overview

Vector Embeddings Project is a comprehensive tool designed to explore and work with vector embeddings in natural language processing (NLP). Utilizing machine learning models, it can encode textual information, find semantic similarities, and more.

## Capabilities

- **Text Encoding**: Convert text into mathematical vectors that capture semantic meaning.
- **Similarity Calculation**: Measure the similarity between words, phrases, or documents.
- **Query Analysis**: Use specific queries to find relevant information within a corpus.
- **Visualization Tools**: Graphically represent vector embeddings to understand their relationships.

## Installation

Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed, then run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Load your model**:
   ```
   from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util
   model = SentenceTransformer('model-path')
   ```

1. **Preprocess your corpus**:

   ```
   corpus = "your text here"
   docs = corpus.split('.')
   ```

2. **Encode and analyze**:

   ```
   corpus_vector = model.encode(docs)
   ```
